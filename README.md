# **Juicyorange Accessible HTML Web Component for Shopify**

This is a respository for custom modular web components, in a take-what-you-need fashion.

It is likely the components will need some configuring when added to a new Shopify instance, but they are built with a shadow DOM and zero external dependencies (besides being on a theme hosted by Shopify, *not* a custom storefront) to minimze this.

## **Tools**
- [jsdoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started) - *API documentation generator for JavaScript.*
- [Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/) - *Web API that provides developers a way to create custom HTML elements with developer-defined behavior.*
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/cli) - *Command-line interface built by Shopify to develop theme and apps locally*
- [Theme Check](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/theme-check) - *Shopify Liquid linter to ensure all Liquid code we write is up to date with current Shopify Liquid sytnax and best practices. Use this with the Shopify CLI, by running `shopify theme check`.*

## **APIS**
